<p>systemd manages logs ... actually, you'd better get yourself a drink before we start on this one.</p>
<p>I'll wait.</p>
<p>What? No, not a frothy latte, that won't do you any good where we're going.<br/>

But okay, fine. Suit yourself. </p>

<p>One of the initial criticisms of systemd was that its logs are in a binary format. Because at 3am in a cold datacentre on a vt100 green screen (if you haven't been there, just don't ask, you don't want to have been there) what you really need is a clear, plain text log of what happened to the system as it went down in flames. But the designers of systemd decided that it would be better for our moral fibre to read the logs through their tools, so - as long as systemd itself is working fine - that's great. Really, it is. It's all absolutely fine. So long as systemd is working fine. And if you're in a cold datacentre, and it's now 3.30am, and trying to dig through systemd log files to find out why you're not tucked up safely in bed, then it seems pretty bloody safe to assume that systemd isn't working fine. So maybe it's not able to read the logs. Oops</p>
<p>At least the systemd developers have a strong reputation for empathising with your situation and doing what they can to help you out.<br/>
Oh. Feck. Yeah, they don't have that reputation, do they? Quite the opposite, in fact. So. You're screwed. And now it's 4am in a cold datacentre. And you're no further along than you were before.</p>
<p>If that frothy latte hasn't gone cold, I hope it's still doing you some good.</p>
<h3>I will write sensible stuff</h3>
<p>Really, I will write some sensible stuff here about logs. Some of it is quite nice. Totally unnecessary, but yeah. Some of it isn't completely terrible.</p>
