systemd will monitor and, if required, restart your processes in quite a sensible manner. Your traditional <code>/etc/init.d/</code> scripts couldn't ever do that, or at least not without some serious help from the application itself. systemd can launch processes, track the main process and/or its children, monitor and even restart them if required.</p>
